CHOICES

First Choice: 1. Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes.
Second Choice: 1. Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
Third Choice: 1. Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: 1. Listen in on what they're saying
Fifth Choice: 1. This is it! Doctor Database just said that Helga is doing home renovations. Maybe that includes plumbing, so she would have access to the murder weapon. It must've been her! Accuse her.
